Here are located the default programming language files for RadASM v2.x

They define a number of specifics for each programming language, that help define how RadASM recognises and processes the various source files associated with a particular language:

- KeyWords recognition:

	- Registers
	- Instructions
	- Directives
	- Logic and control flow
	- Macros

- Codeblock macros

- API functions & parsing

- Themes & colors

- Paths
	- Bin
	- Include
	- Lib
	- Project
	- Templates
	
- Base templates

Not all are implemented for each language - some features are more specific, depending on the programming language.

The files are placed here for ease of access and for future updating.
